##Building a Progress Bar in React.
##Went ahead and created on two components: Input component and Progress Bar component.
##In the Input component, I created an input where you can add a value which will be connected to the progress bar. I went ahead and created a onInput function.
##In the progress component, I used a prop in the function.
